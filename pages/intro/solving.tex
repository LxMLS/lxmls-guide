In the student branch we provide the \verb+solve.py+ script. This can be used
to solve the exercises of each day, e.g.,

\begin{verbatim}
python ./solve.py linear_classifiers
\end{verbatim}

\noindent where the solvable days are: linear\_classifiers, sequence\_models, structure\_predictors, non-linear\_classifiers, non-linear\_sequence\_models, reinforcement\_learning. You can also undo the solving of an exercise by using

\begin{verbatim}
python ./solve.py --undo linear_classifiers
\end{verbatim}

Note that this script just downloads the master or student versions of certain files from the GitHub repository. It needs an Internet connection. Since some exercises require you to have the exercises of the previous days completed, the monitors may ask you to use this function. \textbf{Important:} Remember to save your own version of the code, otherwise it will be overwritten!
