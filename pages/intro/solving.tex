Please note that in order for the exercises to work you need to launch your scripts or use interpreters from inside the  \textit{lxmls-toolkit-student} folder. One detail more and you are off to go. In the student branch we provide the \verb+solve.py+ script. This can be used to solve the exercises of each day, \emph{e.g.}

\begin{verbatim}
python ./solve.py day1
\end{verbatim}

\noindent You can also undo the solving of an exercise by using

\begin{verbatim}
python ./solve.py --undo day1
\end{verbatim}

Note that this script just downloads the master or student versions of certain files from the GitHub repository. It needs an Internet connection. Since some exercises require you to have the exercises of the previous days completed, the monitors may ask you to use this function. Remember to save your own version of the code, otherwise it will be overwritten!
