%As discussed in the lecture, there are many helpful functions in numpy. For basic mathematical operations, we have \code{np.log}, \code{np.exp}, \code{np.cos},\ldots with the expected meaning. These operate both on single arguments and on arrays (where they will behave element wise).

%\begin{python}
%import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%import numpy as np
%X = np.linspace(0, 4 * np.pi, 1000)
%C = np.cos(X)
%S = np.sin(X)

%plt.plot(X, C)
%plt.plot(X, S)
%\end{python}

%Other functions take a whole array and compute a single value from it. For
%example, \code{np.sum}, \code{np.mean},\ldots These are available as both free
%functions and as methods on arrays.

%\begin{python}
%import numpy as np
%A = np.arange(100)
%print np.mean(A)
%print A.mean()

%C = np.cos(A)
%print C.ptp()
%\end{python}

%\begin{exercise}
%Run the above example and lookup the \code{ptp} function/method.
%\end{exercise}

%\begin{exercise}
%Consider the following approximation to compute an integral

%\[
%\int_0^{1} f(x)dx \approx \sum_{i = 0}^{999} \frac{f(i/1000)}{1000}.
%\]

%Use numpy to implement this for $f(x) = x^2$. You should not need to use any
%loops.
%\end{exercise}

%\begin{exercise}
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item Consider the function $f(x) = (x+2)^2 - 16 \exp\left( -(x-2)^2 \right)$.
%Draw a plot around the $x \in [-8,8]$ region.
%\item What is $\pd{f}{x}$?
%\item Use gradient descent to find a local minimum starting from $x_0 = -4$ and
%$x_0 = +4$, with $\eta = .01$. Plot all of the intermediate estimates that you
%obtain in the same plot.
%\end{enumerate}
%\begin{python}
%import numpy as np
%import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%X = np.linspace(-8, 8, 1000)
%Y = (X+2)**2 - 16*np.exp(-((X-2)**2))
%
%# derivative of the function f
%def get_Y_dev(x):
%    return (2*x+4)-16*(-2*x + 4)*np.exp(-((x-2)**2))
%
%def grad_desc(start_x, eps, prec):
%    '''
%    runs the gradient descent algorithm and returns the list of estimates
%
%    example of use grad_desc(start_x=3.9, eps=0.01, prec=0.00001)
%    '''
%    x_new = start_x
%    x_old = start_x + prec * 2
%    res = [x_new]
%    while abs(x_old-x_new) > prec:
%        x_old = x_new
%        x_new = x_old - eps * get_Y_dev(x_new)
%        res.append(x_new)
%    return np.array(res)
%\end{python}
%\end{exercise}

%Over the next couple of exercises we will make use of the Galton dataset, a
%dataset of heights of fathers and sons from the 1877 paper that first discussed
%the ``regression to the mean'' phenomenon.
%
%\begin{exercise}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Use the \texttt{load()} function in the \texttt{galton.py} file to load
%the dataset.
%\item What are the mean height and standard deviation of all the people in the
%sample? What is the mean height of the fathers and of the sons?
%\item Plot a histogram of all the heights (you might want to use the
%\texttt{plt.hist} function and the \texttt{ravel} method on arrays).
%\item Plot the height of the father versus the height of the son.
%\item You should notice that there are several points that are exactly the same
%(e.g., there are 21 pairs with the values 68.5 and 70.2). Use the \texttt{?}
%command in ipython to read the documentation for the \texttt{numpy.random.rand}
%function and add random jitter (i.e., move the point a little bit) to the
%points before displaying them. Does your impression of the data change?
%\end{itemize}
%\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Consider the linear regression problem (ordinary least squares) on the Galton
dataset, with a single response variable

\[
y = x^T w + \varepsilon
\].

The \emph{linear regression problem} is, given a set $\{ y^{(i)} \}_i$ of
samples of $y$ and the corresponding $\vect{x}^{(i)}$ vectors, estimate
$\vect{w}$ to minimise the sum of the $\varepsilon$ variables. Traditionally
this is solved analytically to obtain a closed form solution (although this is
\textbf{not the way in which it should be computed} in this exercise, linear algebra packages
have an optimised solver, with numpy, use \code{numpy.linalg.lstsq}).

Alternatively, we can define the error function for each possible $\vect{w}$:

\[
e(\vect{w}) = \sum_i \left( {\vect{x}^{(i)}}^T \vect{w} - y^{(i)} \right)^2.
\]

\begin{enumerate}
\item Derive the gradient of the error $\pd{e}{w_j}$.
\item Implement a solver based on this for two dimensional problems (i.e.,
$\vect{w} \in R^2$).
\item Use this method on the Galton dataset from the previous exercise to
estimate the relationship between father and son's height. Try two formulas
\begin{equation}
s = f w_1 + \varepsilon,
\label{}
\end{equation}
where $s$ is the son's height, and $f$ is the father heights; and
\begin{equation}
s = f w_1 + 1w_0 + \varepsilon
\label{}
\end{equation}
where the input variable is now two dimensional: $(f,1)$. This allows the
intercept to be non-zero.
\item Plot the regression line you obtain with the points from the previous
exercise.
\item Use the \texttt{np.linalg.lstsq} function and compare to your solution.
\end{enumerate}

Please refer to the notebook for solutions.
\end{exercise}

\subsection{Debugging}


\begin{exercise}
Use the debugger to debug the \texttt{buggy.py} script which attempts to
repeatedly perform the following computation:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Start $x_0 = 0$
\item Iterate

\begin{enumerate}
\item $x'_{t+1} = x_t + r$, where $r$ is a random variable.
\item if $x'_{t+1} >= 1.$, then stop.
\item if $x'_{t+1} <= 0.$, then $x_{t+1} = 0$
\item else $x_{t+1} = x'_{t+1}$.
\end{enumerate}
\item Return the number of iterations.
\end{enumerate}

Having repeated this computation a number of times, the programme prints the
average. Unfortunately, the program has a few bugs, which you need to fix.
\end{exercise}
