%\jg{The goal of this section is two fold, one introduce basic
%  concepts needed further ahead}

In this class we will introduce several fundamental concepts needed further ahead. We start with an introduction to Python, the programming language we will use in the lab sessions. Afterwards, we present several notions on probability theory and linear algebra. Finally, we focus on numerical optimization. 

The goal of this class is to give you the basic knowledge for you to understand the following lectures. We will not enter in too much detail in any of the topics.
