In this class, we relax the assumption that
the data points are independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) 
by moving to a scenario of \emph{structured prediction}, where the inputs are assumed to have
temporal or spacial dependencies. We start by 
considering sequential models, which correspond to a \emph{chain structure}: for instance,
the words in a sentence. In this lecture, we will use part-of-speech
tagging as our example task.  

We start by defining the notation for this lecture in Section~\ref{notation}.
Afterwards, in section~\ref{hmm}, we focus on the well known Hidden Markov Models and in Section~\ref{ml} we describe how to estimate its parameters from labeled data. In Section \ref{decoding} we explain the inference
algorithms (Viterbi and Forward-Backward) for sequence models. These
inference algorithms will be fundamental for the rest of this lecture,
as well as for the next lecture on \emph{discriminative} training of sequence
models. In Section \ref{pos-tagging} we describe the task of 
Part-of-Speech tagging, and how the Hidden Markov Models are suitable for this task. 
Finally, in Section \ref{sec:em} we 
address unsupervised learning of Hidden Markov Models through the Expectation Maximization
algorithm.\todo{NOTA-MA: Falta a ultima Seccao: "`sec:em"'.}

\section*{Today's assignment}

The assignment of today's class is to implement one inference algorithm for Hidden Markov Models, used to find the most likely hidden state sequence given an observation sequence.

\section{Notation}\label{notation}

In what follows, 
we assume a finite set of \emph{observation labels}, 
$\vocab := \{w_1,\ldots,w_J\}$,
and a finite set of \emph{state labels}, 
$\statevocab := \{c_1,\ldots, c_K\}$.
Let $\varepsilon$ be the empty string, 
we denote by 
$\vocab^* := \{\varepsilon\} \cup \vocab \cup \vocab^2 \cup \ldots$ and 
$\statevocab^* := \{\varepsilon\} \cup \statevocab \cup \statevocab^2  \cup \ldots$ the Kleene closure 
of each of the two sets above. 
Elements of $\vocab^*$ and $\statevocab^*$ 
are \emph{strings of observations} and \emph{strings of states}, 
respectively. 
Throughout this class, we 
assume our input set is $\X = \vocab^*$, 
and our output set is $\Y = \statevocab^*$. 
In other words, 
our inputs are observation sequences, 
$x = x_1 x_2 \ldots x_N$, 
for some $N \in \mathbb{N}$, where each $x_i \in \vocab$;
given such a $x$, we seek 
the corresponding state sequence, 
$y = y_1 y_2 \ldots y_N$, 
where each $y_i \in \statevocab$. We also consider two special states: the ${\tt start}$ symbol,
which starts the sequence, and 
the ${\tt stop}$ symbol, which ends the sequence. 

Moreover, in this lecture we will assume two scenarios:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \emph{Supervised learning.} We will 
train models from a sample set of paired observation and state sequences, $\mathcal{D}_L := \{(x^1,y^1), \ldots, (x^M,y^M)\} \subseteq \X \times \Y$.
\item \emph{Unsupervised learning.} We will
train models from the set of observations only, $\mathcal{D}_U := \{x^1, \ldots, x^M\} \subseteq \X$.
\end{enumerate}
Our notation is summarized in Table~\ref{tab:hmm_notation}.

%Let $\X = \{\sent^1, \ldots, \sent^D\}$ be a training set of independent
%and identically-distributed random variables. In this work $\sent^d$
%(for notation simplicity we will drop the superscript $d$ when
%considering an isolated example) corresponds to a sentence in natural
%language and decomposes as a sequence of observations of length $N$: $\sent = \obs_1 \ldots
%\obs_N$. Each $\obs_n$ is a discrete
%random variable (a \emph{word}),  taking a value $\vv$ from a
%finite vocabulary $\vocab$. Each $\sent$ has an unknown hidden
%structure $\hseq$  that we want to predict. The
%structures are sequences $\hseq = \hs_1 \ldots \hs_N$ of the same
%length $N$ as the observations. Each hidden state $\hs_n$ is a discrete
%random variable and can take a value $\hv$ from a discrete vocabulary $\hvocab$.
